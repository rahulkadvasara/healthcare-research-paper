# 🧠 Agentic Clinical Healthcare Assistant

A Safety-Aware Multi-Agent AI System for Clinical Assistance, Drug Interaction Checking, and Medical Report Analysis.

---

## 📌 Overview

The **Agentic Clinical Healthcare Assistant** is a full-stack AI-powered system that integrates multiple intelligent agents to provide:

- Symptom guidance
- Medicine reminder scheduling
- Drug interaction risk analysis
- Medical report analysis from images (OCR-based)
- Layman-friendly health explanations
- Multi-user authentication and persistent memory

The system is designed as a **safety-aware, memory-augmented, multi-agent architecture** suitable for healthcare AI research.

---

## 🏗 System Architecture

The project follows a **Multi-Agent Orchestration Model**.

### Core Agents

1. **Coordinator Agent**
   - Routes user requests based on detected intent.
   - Handles chat, reminders, drug interactions, and report analysis.

2. **Chat Agent**
   - Handles symptom-related and general health queries.
   - Uses contextual memory for personalized responses.

3. **Reminder Agent**
   - Extracts medicine name and time.
   - Performs safety check before scheduling.
   - Uses risk-based gating:
     - Low → Schedule
     - Moderate → Schedule with warning
     - High → Block scheduling

4. **Drug Interaction Agent**
   - Analyzes interactions among stored medicines.
   - Returns risk level (Low / Moderate / High).
   - Ensures safe reminder scheduling.

5. **Report Agent**
   - Uses Tesseract OCR to extract text from medical report images.
   - Converts technical medical reports into layman-friendly summaries.
   - Removes markdown, lab ranges, and technical jargon.
   - Provides simplified health explanation with recommendation.

## 🧠 Memory Design

### Persistent Memory (SQLite)
- Users (id, email, password, name)
- Medicines
- Reminders

### Short-Term Context
- Stored medicines retrieved per session
- Used for contextual reasoning and interaction checks

### Safety Logic
- Drug interaction verification before database insertion
- Conditional scheduling based on risk classification

---

## 🔐 Authentication

- Secure Register & Login
- Password hashing using bcrypt
- Multi-user support
- Session stored via localStorage (frontend)

## 🚀 Setup Instructions

### 1️⃣ Clone Repository

git clone <repository-url>  
cd agentic-healthcare-assistant  

---

### 2️⃣ Backend Setup

cd backend  

python -m venv venv  
venv\Scripts\activate      # Windows  

pip install -r requirements.txt  

Create a `.env` file inside backend:

GROQ_API_KEY=your_groq_api_key_here  

Run backend:

python app.py  

Backend will start at:  
http://127.0.0.1:5000  

---

### 3️⃣ Frontend Setup

cd frontend  

python -m http.server 5500  

Open in browser:

http://localhost:5500/pages/login.html  

---

## 🔐 Authentication Flow

1. Register with email and password  
2. Password is securely hashed using bcrypt  
3. Login returns user_id  
4. user_id is stored in localStorage  
5. All chat and reminder requests use this user_id  

---

## 🧠 System Workflow

1. User sends message or uploads report  
2. Coordinator Agent detects intent  
3. Request is routed to:
   - ChatAgent
   - ReminderAgent
   - InteractionAgent
   - ReportAgent
4. Persistent memory is retrieved from SQLite  
5. Safety checks performed if needed  
6. Response returned to frontend  

---

## 🩺 Drug Interaction Safety Logic

Before scheduling a reminder:

1. Retrieve stored medicines  
2. Add new medicine to temporary list  
3. Send list to InteractionAgent  
4. Risk classified as:
   - Low → Schedule normally  
   - Moderate → Schedule with warning  
   - High → Block scheduling  
5. Save reminder only if safe  

This ensures conditional execution in healthcare context.

## 📷 OCR Configuration

Install Tesseract OCR.

Ensure correct path in:

backend/tools/report_image_processor.py  

Example:

pytesseract.pytesseract.tesseract_cmd = r"D:\Tesseract-OCR\tesseract.exe"

Make sure:
- "Run as administrator" is NOT enabled for tesseract.exe
